## About

**Frontend Interview Hub** is an interactive platform I built to organize and practice **frontend interview questions**.  
Itâ€™s designed as both a **learning tool** and a **self-testing app**, wrapped as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** so it can be installed directly on your desktop or mobile for quick access.

On the site, you can:

- **Browse by category** (JavaScript, CSS, React, etc.)
- **Filter questions** inside each category either by **knowledge level** (Beginner, Mid, Senior) or by **specific topics**
- **Explore all questions at once** without categories
- **Switch between two study modes**:
  - _Quiz mode_ (only the question is visible, answer appears on click)
  - _Learning mode_ (questions and answers open together)

Thereâ€™s also a **favourites system**:

- Mark questions as favourites ðŸ’š
- Access them later in a dedicated **Favourites tab**
- Requires a simple **registration/login** to save your personalized list

This project combines **structured interview preparation** with **practical React development**, giving me a space to improve my coding skills while building something useful for other developers.

## Features

  - **HTML**
